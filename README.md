# FDMdish
A 3D printable parabolic dish antenna, written in OpenSCAD, with examples rendered for immediate print.



FDMdish is a 3D printed, highly accurate, and scalable parabolic reflector surface suitable for use in a high gain radio antenna setup.
The parametric model is generated in OpenSCAD, STLs can be exported and used with the accompanying CURA slicer settings to produce a series of 3D printed tiles.

Oh, and FDM is for FreeDoM.

Ingredients:
1) Ideal 3D printer: Artillery Sidewinder X1, with a 0.8mm nozzle for 1mm line width and 0.5mm layer height. Or equivalent machine
2) A few KG of PLA filament, the slicer will tell you how much you need, white is less likely to melt in the sun than black
3) Lengths of 2020 vslot extrusion or square hollow section, other widths are possible if you want to modify the script
4) Brackets to hold the 2020 extrusion in a sturdy frame (see images for examples)
4) M5 (ideal), M4 or M3 fasteners and slot nuts
5) Beers and patience
6) Conductive tape, or conductive nickel spray paint for the reflector surface

Method:
1) Specific custom tiles can be generated by adjusting the parameters in the OpenSCAD script
2) Whole dish assemblies can be batch rendered by modifying the parameters in the script, and running gen_dish.sh
3) The rendered STL files will be stored in the ./render folder
4) Load each of these files into your slicer of choice (an optimised profile for CURA and the Sidewinder X1 has been included for tips)
5) The 3D printer and slicer should be set up for printing of dimensionally accurate functional components, otherwise there may be a few tight fits
	print each tile out, trimming the brim
5) Once printed, the tiles can be fastened to a grid of 2020 extrusion
6) Get creative with ensuring the surface of the dish is electrically conductive, at least in the direction of polarisation, examples include:
	Copper tape, spaced less than 1/10 wavelength apart
	Conductive nickel spray paint
	AluminIum foil and adhesive
	Thin wire, taped down, ghetto pride
	
	
Hints on SCAD tweaking:
-A high speed, thick layer height print process is unlikely to be tolerant of anything more than a 45deg overhang. So the on-axis diameter should be less than the focal length. 
	-For a square dish, the corners are likely to exceed this requirement and may need to be discarded.
	-Where F=1/2d

Hints on slicer settings:
-The SCAD model and slicer settings have been optimised for each other, so the outcome may be less than ideal with a narrower nozzle
-The structural strength comes from the aluminium extrusion, these panels are designed to be rigid and low warp, but not load bearing
-1 shell wall, fill of approximately 5-10% with a zigzag pattern seems to provide enough strength to prevent warping in the paraboloid as it cools
-Black gloss filament is good as a prototyping filament, because the quality of the surface can be quickly observed by looking for variations in the  reflective sheen as the tile is rotated under a point source of illumination 
-printing with a brim is essential (these components are large, with a low bed contact area, and are otherwise likely to lift off the bed)
